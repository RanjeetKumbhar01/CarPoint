# CarPoint: Car Model Recommendation System
This project aims to develop a web-based application that allows users to find their dream car model based on their requirements using machine learning algorithms. The application will use a dataset of car models with their specifications, such as brand, model year, engine displacement, transmission, fuel type, and other features, to make recommendations to users based on their input.

## Project Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:

* To build a machine learning model that can recommend car models based on user requirements, such as budget, preferred brand, body type, fuel type, and other features.
* To develop a web-based application that allows users to input their requirements and receive personalized car recommendations.
* To provide users with detailed information about the recommended car models, such as specifications, reviews, and pricing information.
* To continuously improve the recommendation algorithm by collecting user feedback and updating the model.
